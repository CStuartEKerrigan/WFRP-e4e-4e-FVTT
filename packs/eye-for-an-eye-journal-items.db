Andreas was the second son of a cousin of Graf&nbsp;Sigismund, patriarch of the very powerful von Jungfreud family. Due to the young man&rsquo;s relatively high birth, charm, and undeniably keen intellect, he should have been granted a much more prestigious seat to control. Such an apparent snub caused a minor stir amongst those who maintained an interest in the affairs of the aristocracy, though the event went unnoticed by the general population of Reikland.</p>\n<p>However, what became more widely known was the mysterious disappearance of Andreas shortly thereafter.

{"name":"House Aschaffenberg","permission":{"default":0,"Cq31UaFnLVMpY5dr":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>Emperor Magnus the Pious elevated the Aschaffenbergs to nobility, granting them land once ruled by a minor branch of House Walfen. Most of their wealth comes from ore mines and the river Teufel, both in terms of the trade and fishing. Forays to clear the Greenskins from Aschaffen land near the mining town of Blitzh&ouml;he are an annual event, meaning many of the local nobles have significant military experience.</p>\n<p>The current graf, Brynich Aschaffenberg, is an ambitious man&nbsp;with many heirs. In recent years he has secured for his eldest&nbsp;son, Tobias, the prestigious position of Margrave of the Grey&nbsp;Lady Pass. He also negotiated a marriage between his second&nbsp;son, Rickard, and Ludmilla von Bruner, Graf Steirlich&rsquo;s only&nbsp;daughter. This planned union is an impressive feat given the&nbsp;historic tensions between the two noble households.</p>\n<p>Not long&nbsp;ago, Byrnich returned to the duchy from his manor in Ubersreik&nbsp;after the Emperor removed his erstwhile allies, the Jungfreuds,&nbsp;from power.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-e4e/assets/images/handouts/ashaffenberg.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"191\" height=\"234\" /></p>","_id":"37NgiXizCpxMrFvj"}
{"name":"House Bruner","permission":{"default":0,"Cq31UaFnLVMpY5dr":3},"flags":{},"content":"<p>The seat of the ruling Bruners, Steirlich Manor, is a heavily&nbsp;fortified lodge. House Bruner draws immense wealth from its deep&nbsp;mines sunk into the southern H&auml;gercrybs, and despite centuries&nbsp;of affluence, the mines there show no signs of playing out. The&nbsp;Bruners bought the neighbouring duchy of Karstadt some decades&nbsp;ago from the troubled House Karstadt, which brought fertile&nbsp;farmlands and the major road into Ubersreik under Bruner control,&nbsp;not to mention a number of profitable tollgates. The Bruners&nbsp;demanded the Karstadts surrendered their patent of nobility as a&nbsp;term of the sale, which was supported by the ruling Jungfreuds&nbsp;at the time, effectively making the Karstadts commoners.</p>\n<p>Graf Steirlich is the head of this house,&nbsp; and he is a driven and determined man. He regularly&nbsp;rides his land, hunting bandits, beasts, and fowl with equal&nbsp;enthusiasm. He takes little interest in politics, leaving such affairs&nbsp;to his mother Kisaiya von Bruner and his nephew,&nbsp;Heissman. He recently gifted the&nbsp;castle of Ulmeturm to his niece Ludmilla as a wedding gift,&nbsp;celebrating her upcoming union with Rickard Aschaffenberg.</p>\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; border: 0\" src=\"modules/wfrp4e-e4e/assets/images/handouts/bruner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"237\" height=\"311\" /></p>","_id":"JL6MftuciPpyZ13Q"}

He is the God of Obsession, the Master of Excess in All Things, from gluttony to lust to megalomania. Out of all the pantheon, Slaanesh is the youngest of the Chaos Gods, for the complex emotions of erotic desire and decadence can only exist within the minds of intelligent races.</p>\n<p>In one sense, Slaanesh is the embodiment of romantic passion and the desire to create vibrant art. Those that most openly express such emotions are often artists, craftsmen, dancers and the more flamboyant nobles of the southern realms. However, the Prince of Chaos is also the embodiment of hubris, pride, sensation, selfish pleasure and pain-as-pleasure. Every breath is an opportunity to take in a new scent. Each glass raised is a chance to savour a new flavour. On every battlefield, each sword blow can entice a never before heard scream of pain.</p>\n<p>From his glittering palace in the Realm of Chaos, the Lord of Excess revels in each new sensation discovered. He guides and directs the mortal inhabitants of the world to go ever further in pursuit of new heights of sensation with no concern for the morality of their quest.</p>\n<p>Unlike the influence of the other Chaos Gods, Slaanesh's power is more prevalent amongst the civilised nations of the Old World. The warlike tribes of the north have very little time to indulge themselves in their desires, for every waking moment is a simple fight for survival. As a result, perhaps the most numerous disciples of Slaanesh hail from the decadent peoples of the south. It is only from here that a person can indulge themselves in the pleasures of life, such as beautiful artwork, culinary delights, extravagant clothing, and the pleasures of the flesh. And none have more time and wealth to indulge themselves in such delights than the wealthy nobles of the southern aristocracy.</p>","_id":"SfE1Nf0AtObuxMWS"}
