# Eye for An Eye

Content for the [WFRP4e system](https://github.com/CatoThe1stElder/WFRP-4th-Edition-FoundryVTT) to be used with the [Foundry Virtual Tabletop](https://foundryvtt.com/). Based on the  *Eye for an Eye* adventure, converted from Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 3rd Edition for Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay 4th Edition published by Cubicle 7. 

[The 30+ page 4E conversion for the module can be downloaded for free here](https://perilousrealm.itch.io/eye) so you should have all the resources you need to bring Grunewald Lodge to life with that and this pack.

## Contents
* Actors from the module.
* 5 scenes - the maps commissioned were by Tom Cartos and were commissioned by Ratcatcher's Guild user Mark Johnson who [kindly shared them with the community](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/qm7zu91nc473g9r/AADeAzoL9bGrUkJkJmJ1v3HSa?dl=0) 
* Macros that will be of use during the scenario
	* Open All Doors: Opens all doors on the map with one click or button press.
	* Close All Doors: Closes all doors on the map similarly. Useful just prior to placing players on the map.
	* Roll Weapon Trait: Rolls the selected monster's weapon trait.
	* Switch Images: Several of the characters have multiple tokens for dramatic reveals of their darker natures. This macro switches them.
* Audio files - including haunting whispers from the painting, and cultists chanting the daemon's name.
* Token files - full tokens for the NPC cast, including multiple tokens for mysterious enemies with several forms.
* Unique item (Korden's Hammer) and unique trait (reformulated as a talent to appear when the NPC uses the appropriate skill).
* Script - Korden's Hammer: This script will check if it is used against the chief villain in the game and will provide a chat message with extra properties.
